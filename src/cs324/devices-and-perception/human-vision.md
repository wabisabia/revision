# Human Vision

## World properties inferred from images:

- Shape from **shading**, **texture gradients** and **motion parallax**

- Depth from **occlusion boundaries** and **stereo**

## Eye Anatomy

- Light refracted by **cornea** through the **pupil** then focused by **lens** on to **fovea**

## Field of View

- Fibres from eyes meet at **optic chasm**
- Left visual field fibres go to right **lateral geniculate nucleus(LGN)**
- Right visual field fibres go to left **LGN**
- Fibres project from **LGN** to **primary visual cortex**

## Retina

- First stage of neural processing
- 5 layers of cell (**photoreceptors**) performing image analysis

## Photoreceptors

### Cones

- Less sensitive than rods
- Dominate central area of vision in the **fovea**
- Infer colour through received wavelengths
- 6 million per eye
- Types
  - Yellow-Green (Red)
  - Blue-Green (Green)
  - Violet (Blue)

### Rods

- Can't discriminate colour / detects luminance
- Used for peripheral and night vision
- 120 million per eye

## Perception of Intensity

- Irradiance: Power per unit are
- Radiance: Power per wavelength interval
- Luminance: Relative brightness of a source
- Steven's Law: \\( S = I^v \\)
  - S: perceived sensation
  - I: actual intensity
- Weber's Law (Intensity Difference): \\(JND = \frac{\Delta I}{I} \approx 0.01\\)
  - JND: Just Noticeable Difference
