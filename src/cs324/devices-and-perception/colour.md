# Colour

## CIE Chromaticity Diagram

Designed by Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage

Defines colour-space relating electromagnetic wavelength distribution to human colour vision

Coordinates represent relative fractions of tristimulus values present in a given XYZ colour model

\begin{align}
x=\frac{X}{X+Y+Z}
y=\frac{Y}{X+Y+Z}
z=\frac{Z}{X+Y+Z}=1-x-y
x+y+z=1
\end{align}

## Glossary

- Hue - Distinguishes between colours
- Saturation - How far a colour is from a grey of the same
  intensity
- Lightness - Achromatic perception of perceived intensity
  reflected from an object
- Brightness - Achromatic perception of perceived intensity
  from a self-luminous object

## Grassman Colour Matching Laws

- Scaling colour by factor:
  - 2C = 2R + 2G + 2B
- Adding colours:

  - (C1 + C2) = (R1 + R2) + (G1 + G2) + (B1 + B2)
