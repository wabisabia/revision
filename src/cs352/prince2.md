| Pros                    | Cons                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Only for large projects | Fully scalable, tailored        |
| Constrained approach    | step-by-step, stages            |
| Inflexible, not "agile" | iterative stages, change theme  |
| Mountains of paperwork  | Needn't be, audit trail useful  |
| Not solution oriented   | Product oriented                |
| Bureaucratic            | Maintains control, by exception |
