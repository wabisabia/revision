## Product Backlog and User Stories

### User Stories

Unit of a Product Backlog

Structure: "As a <type of user>, I want <some goal> so that <some reason>"

### Product Backlog

Built by Product Owner

Augment User Stories with

- Priority
- Estimated size/effort
- Definition of done

Epic: group of related User Stories
Theme: top-level objective of product/project

Captures scope/requirements: who, what and why, not how

## Artifacts

- User Story - small piece of functionality to work on in a sprint
- Task - may be unrelated to User Story
- Product Backlog - list of User Stories and Tasks for future sprints
- Sprint Backlog - list of User Stories and Tasks for current sprint
- Product Increment - potentially shippable piece of functionality at the end of a sprint
- Extensions - Reports like Burndown Chart, Velocity, etc. to track team's progress

### Burndown Chart

- Depicts remaining effort for sprint
- Allows team **_velocity_** to be estimated
- Scrum Master
  - Gets team to fix estimation
  - Ensure additional storiesready to be added into the sprint

## Daily Stand Up
