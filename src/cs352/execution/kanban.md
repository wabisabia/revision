## Flow of Supply and Demand

Supply flows **_downstream_**

Demand flows **_upstream_**

## Method

1. Work is **_pulled_** from backlog [Just-In-Time](lean.md#pillars)
1. Only take work when there is capacity **_downstream_**

## Work In Progress (WIP)

- Forces team/member to work on a **_limited_** number of tasks
- Reduces [muri](lean.md#waste) and overhead of context-switching
- "Leaner to finish one thing to 100% than two to 50%"

## Pull System

- Start new work **_on demand_**
- No to-do list, no muri, complete one thing and then pull next
- "Leaner to focus on completing only what is required"

## Blockers and Idleness

- Taking on work to improve **_your_** output works against the **_team_**
  - Won't maximise **_value_**
  -
- Being blocked forces team to collaborate
  - Focus on solving bottleneck
  - Improve process to achieve [Heijunka](lean.md#foundation)
