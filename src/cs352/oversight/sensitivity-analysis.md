# Sensitivity Analysis

Models how an independent variable impacts a dependent variable

Can build models from

- Simple estimation
- Simulation
- Empirical data

Spider Graph: plots dependent variable against deviations of the independent variable from a baseline

Tornado Diagram: summarises relative importance of different variables
