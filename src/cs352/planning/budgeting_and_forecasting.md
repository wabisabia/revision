# Budgeting and Forecasting

## Budgeting

Inputs

- Project Management Plan
- Project Charter / Brief
- Environmental Factors and Organisational Assets

Outputs

- Cost Management Plan - how organisation manages **cost variance**
- Activity Estimates - **estimated** cost of each activity
- Cost Baseline - **initial** budget

### Estimation Methods

- Analogous - how much it cost last time
- Parametric - same as analogous but use a mathematical model, e.g. cost/X
  - Usually one of three types:

| Metric                 | Budgeting Target Example          |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Cost/Time              | HR                                |
| Cost/Use               | Venue use/cleaning service        |
| Cost/Material Consumed | Food and drink/bricks for a house |

- Team-based - aggregate team members' estimations
- Three-point - \\(m\\) mean, \\(a\\) min, \\(b\\) max
  - \\(t\_{\text{triangular}}=\frac{a+m+b}{3}\\)
  - \\(t\_\beta=\frac{a+4m+b}{6}\\)
